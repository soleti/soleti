### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m a physicist at the [Donostia International Physics Cener](http://www.dipc.org) currently working on the [NEXT](https://next.ific.uv.es/next/) experiment, which is looking for an ultra-rare conversion nuclear process called _neutrinoless double beta decay_. I also developed a [physics detector simulator](https://github.com/DUNE/larnd-sim) that runs entirely on GPUs for the [DUNE](https://www.dunescience.org) experiment, the next-generation largest neutrino detector in the world.
